# shakeYourFistAtTheSky

Practice jQuery and Promises and optionally Handlebars
 
* Accept two dates from the user (year, month, day) as a search parameter.
* Use the NASA API (https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#NeoWS) to make an ajax call that will gather data about what objects will be close to our planet in the timeframe specified by the user’s dates.
* Using the data you get back from NASA (promises!), use FOAAS to tell three of those asteroids to fuck off, by name.  http://www.foaas.com/
* You can use whichever of the foaas message types you like.

* Print these sky-fist-shaking statements to the DOM
 
## Bonus: 
* Only tell those asteroids that are “potentially hazardous” to fuck off.
* Use different messages from foaas for the different asteroids.
* Use Handlebars to print your three messages to the DOM
